23.0,CRUSHER,We need to get off this deck. Follow me.,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
24.0,PICARD,"The first thing they'll do in engineering is establish a collective, a central point from which they can control the hive.

23.0,GUINAN,Soran is a name I haven't heard in a long time.,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,You remember him?,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,Yes.,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,"Guinan. It is very important that you tell me everything that you know. We think that Soran has developed a weapon, ...a terrible weapon. One that might even give him enough power to destroy...",[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,Soran doesn't care about weapons or power. He just cares about getting back to the Nexus.,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,What's the 'Nexus'?,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,"The energy ribbon that destroyed that ship was just not some random phenomenon travelling through the universe. It's a doorway to another place that we call the Nexus. It's a place that I've tried very, very hard to forget.",[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,What happened to you?,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,It was like being inside joy. As if joy was something tangible ...and you could wrap yourself in it like a blanket. And never in my entire life have I been as content.,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,And then you were beamed away from there.,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,"Pulled. Ripped away. None of us wanted to go. I would have done anything, ...anything to get back there. But once I realised that wasn't possible I learned to live without that.",[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,What about Soran?,[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,"If he's still obsessed he could be a very, very dangerous man.",[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,PICARD,"Why would he destroy a star? ...Thank you, Guinan.",[Guinan's quarters],
23.0,GUINAN,"If you go, you're not going to care about anything. Not this ship, Soran, nothing. All you'll want is to stay in the Nexus. And you're not going to want to come back.",[Guinan's quarters],
24.0,SORAN,Marvellous technology. This is a remarkable piece of equipment.,[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
24.0,LAFORGE,I'm glad you approve.,[Bird-of-Prey quarters],(Soran is studying Geordi's VISOR)
24.0,SORAN,"Not very stylish though is it? ...Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more, ...how can I say? ...More normal.",[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
24.0,LAFORGE,What's normal?,[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
24.0,SORAN,"What's normal? Well, that's a good question. Normal is what everyone else is, and you are not.",[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
24.0,LAFORGE,Why don't we just get down to it? What do you want?,[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
24.0,SORAN,"As you may or may not be aware, I am an ElAurian. Some people call us a race of 'listeners'. We listen. Right now, Mister La Forge, you have my complete attention. I want to listen to everything you know about trilithium.",[Bird-of-Prey quarters],
25.0,DATA (OC),"According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through this galaxy every thirtynine point one years. It will pass through this sector in approximately fortytwo hours.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Yes. Guinan was right. She said that Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. Now if that's true there has to be some connection with the Amargosa star. Data, give me a list of anything that was affected by the star's destruction, no matter how insignificant.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,Data?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,Sorry sir. It will take the computer a few moments to compile the information.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Data, ...are you all right?",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"No sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse, regret concerning my actions on the observatory.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,What do you mean?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"I wanted to save Geordi, but I experienced something I could not expect. ...Fear. I was afraid. ...According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector. ...Gamma emissions have increased by point zero five percent. The Starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction. ...Ambient magnetic fields...",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,Wait. The Bozeman. ...Why would it make a course correction?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout this sector. As a result any ship passing through this region would have to make a minor course correction.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,A minor course correction? ...Where's the ribbon now?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,This is its current position.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,Can you project its course?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"Captain, ...I cannot continue with this investigation. I wish to be deactivated until Doctor Crusher can remove the emotion chip.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,Are you having some kind of malfunction?,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,No sir. I simply do not have the ability to control these emotions.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Data, I have nothing but sympathy for what you are feeling, but right now I need you to...",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,Sir! I no longer want these emotions! Deactivating me is the only viable solution.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Part of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life, Data, ...learning to live with them. No matter what the circumstances...",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"No, I cannot...",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"You will not be deactivated! You're an officer on board this ship and I require you to perform your duty. That is an order, Commander!",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"Yes sir. ...I will try, sir.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data. Courage can be an emotion too. Now can you project the course of the ribbon?",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,I believe so.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"Enhance grid nineA. ...Where was the Amargosa star? ...Now you said when the Amargosa star was destroyed, it affected the gravitational forces in this sector. Did the computer take that into account when it projected the course of the ribbon?",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,No sir. I will make the appropriate adjustments.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"That's what Soran's doing, ...he's changing the course of the ribbon. ...But why? Why would he try to change its path? ...Why doesn't he just fly into it with a ship?",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"He can't get to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. ...Data, does it pass near any MClass planets?",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,Yes sir. There are two in the Veridian system.,[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,PICARD,"It's close to Veridian Three ...but not close enough. ...Data, what would happen to the ribbon's course if Soran destroyed the Veridian star itself? ...That's where he's going.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],
25.0,DATA,"It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.",[Enterprise Stellar Cartography],

27.0,TROI,Perhaps they're on the surface.,[Enterprise-D bridge],
27.0,WORF,"Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet's surface will take eleven seconds to reach the sun.

66.0,PICARD,How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive?,[Enterprise-E ready room],

66.0,DOUGHERTY,"It's the concentration in the rings that makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. When it's over, the planet will be uninhabitable for generations.",[Enterprise-E ready room],
66.0,PICARD,"Admiral, delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.",[Enterprise-E ready room],
66.0,DOUGHERTY,Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.,[Enterprise-E ready room],
66.0,PICARD,Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do.,[Enterprise-E ready room],
66.0,DOUGHERTY,"It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of the Briar Patch. ...Who would?",[Enterprise-E ready room],
66.0,PICARD,The Ba'ku. ...We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded. It's an attack upon its very soul. ...And it will destroy the Ba'ku ...just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.,[Enterprise-E ready room],

As you can see we have a great deal to offer, but that is small compared to what we know, ...or rather what we don't know, about whales. The first commonly held misconception is that whales are fish.

44.0,GILLIAN,"To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. One hundred years ago, using handthrown harpoons, man did plenty of damage, ...but that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century. ...This is mankind's legacy, whales hunted to the brink of extinction. Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature ever to inhabit the Earth. Despite all attempts at banning whaling, there are still countries and pirates currently engaged in the slaughter of these inoffensive creatures. Where the humpback whale once numbered in the hundreds of thousands, today there are less than ten thousand specimens alive and those that are taken are no longer fully grown.

It is a process whereby molecular structure is reorganised at he subatomic level into lifegenerating matter of equal mass. Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the laboratory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground. Stage Three will involve the process on a planetary scale. It is our intention to introduce the Genesis device into the preselected area of a lifeless space body, such a moon or other dead form. The device is delivered, instantaneously causing what we call the Genesis Effect. Matter is reorganised with lifegenerating results. ...Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet, capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.",[Kirk's quarters],
