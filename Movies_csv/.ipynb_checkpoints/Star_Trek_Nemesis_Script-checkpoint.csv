1.0,SURAN (OC),"Senators, consider the opportunities for the Empire. At last the destinies of the planets, Romulus and Remus, will be united. Shinzon of Remus is offering us a chance to make ourselves stronger...",[Romulan Senate building],ROMULAN IMPERIAL SENATE
2.0,,,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,SURAN,...than ever before. It would be madness to resist it. I beg you to not let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance. By joining Shinzon's forces with ours not even the Federation will be able to stand in our way.,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,HIREN,That's enough! The decision has been made. The military does not dictate policy on Romulus.,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,,,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,HIREN,The Senate has considered Shinzon's proposal and rejected it. He and his followers will be met with all deliberate force and sent back to that black rock they come from. Do I make myself clear!,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,COMMANDER #2,Yes sir.,[Romulan Senate chamber],"(a female senator, Tal'aura, looks down at a red circular box on the table in front of her)"

2.0,,,[Romulan Senate chamber],
2.0,HIREN (OC),As you know the Reman mines have not been filling their quotas for months now. I hope you will all bear in mind the trade committee's findings.,[Romulan Senate chamber],

3.0,PICARD,"Duty. ...A starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty. I have commanded men in battle. I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies. I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species, but none of this compares to my solemn duty today ...as best man. Now, I know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union. But have you two considered what you are doing to me? Of course you're happy, but what about my needs? This is all a damned inconvenience, and while you're happily settling in on the Titan, I will be training my new first officer. You all know him. He's a tyrannical martinet who'll never, ever allow me to go on away missions!",[Earth - Alaska pavilion],(everybody in the chamber shrivels to rocks and dust)

3.0,RIKER/TROI,No.,[Earth - Alaska pavilion],(more laughter)
3.0,PICARD,"No? Oh very well then. ...Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for fifteen years. You have kept my course true and steady. ...Deanna Troi, you've been my guide ...and my conscience. You have helped me recognise the better parts of myself. You are my family. ...And in best maritime tradition ...I wish you both clear horizons. ...My good friends, ...make it so. ...The bride and groom.",[Earth - Alaska pavilion],

3.0,RIKER,"No, no speeches and ...no clothes.",[Earth - Alaska pavilion],
3.0,DATA,"Ladies and Gentlemen and invited transgendered species. In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift.

4.0,WORF,Positronic.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,LAFORGE,It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,What do we know about it?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,LAFORGE,Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,Theories?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,DATA,"Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorise there is an android on Kolarus Three.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD (OC),Just what I was afraid of.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,RIKER,"Captain, diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,"It's still well on our side. I think... I think it's worth taking a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll still have you to Betazed with plenty of time to spare...",[Enterprise-E bridge],

4.0,DATA,Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilisation in an early stage of industrial development.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,LAFORGE,"Captain, I wouldn't recommend using the transporter. That ion storm doesn't look very neighbourly. It could head in our direction without much warning.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,"Understood. ...Data, Mister Worf, you're with me.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,RIKER,"Captain, I don't have to remind you....",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,"I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try the Argo.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,RIKER,I'll bet.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
4.0,PICARD,Captain's prerogative. There's no foreseeable danger ...and your wife would never forgive me if anything were to happen to you.,[Enterprise-E bridge],

5.0,PICARD,"Mister Worf, bring it to the vehicle.",[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,,,[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,PICARD,This doesn't feel right.,[Kolarus III surface],

5.0,B-4 HEAD,Why do you have a shiny head?,[Kolarus III surface],(they are disturbed by weapons fire from a group 'dune-buggies' coming over the hill)
5.0,DATA,This is not the appropriate time for a conversation.,[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,B-4 HEAD,Why?,[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,DATA,Because the Captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.,[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,B-4 HEAD,Why?,[Kolarus III surface],
5.0,DATA,Because...,[Kolarus III surface],

6.0,RIKER,"So what have we got, Geordi?",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
6.0,LAFORGE,"Well, I'd say he has the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic development. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I'd say he's a ...prototype. Something Doctor Soong created prior to Data.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],

7.0,PICARD,Understood.,[Enterprise-E ready room],
7.0,JANEWAY (OC),"We're sending you all the intelligence we have,...",[Enterprise-E ready room],

9.0,,,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
9.0,DATA,"As you can see one side of Remus always faces the sun. Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet. ...Almost nothing is known about the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction. ...The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
9.0,RIKER,"But they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors. In the Dominion War, Reman troops were used as assault forces in the most violent encounters.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],

9.0,PICARD,What have you learned about Shinzon?,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
9.0,DATA,"Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander. He fought twelve major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],

10.0,LAFORGE,I still can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,"Captain Picard agrees that the B-4 was probably designed with the same self-actualisation parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE (OC),"Yes, but he would have all your memories as well. Do you feel comfortable with that?",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,"I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE,"An individual more like you, you mean.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,Yes.,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE,"Maybe he's not supposed to be like you, Data. Maybe he's supposed to be exactly the way he is.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,"That might be so, but I believe he should have the opportunity to explore his potential.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],

10.0,B-4,Captain? ...No.,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE,"Data, he's assimilating a lot of programming. Remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are. We just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt. We really need to give him some time.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,"Geordi, what purpose does this serve?",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE,What?,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,This.,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,LAFORGE,That's a redundant memory port. Maybe the provisional memory storage is in case his neural pathways overload? ...Do you mind if I keep him here for a while. ...Run a few diagnostics?,[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
10.0,DATA,"No, I do not mind.",[Enterprise-E engineering laboratory],
