1.0,SULU,According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.,[Excelsior bridge],(a huge explosion spreading out through space)
1.0,,,[Excelsior bridge],"Stardate 9521.6, Captain's log, U.S.S. Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding. After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in the Beta Quadrant. We're heading home under full impulse power. I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well."
1.0,VALTANE,I have an energy wave from two hundred and forty degrees mark six port.,[Excelsior bridge],

1.0,SULU,"Praxis is their key energy production facility. ...Send to Klingon High Command. 'This is Excelsior, a Federation starship. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do you require assistance?'",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,RAND,Aye sir.,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,"Mister Valtane, any more data?",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,VALTANE,"Yes sir. I have confirmed the location of Praxis, sir, but...",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,What is it?,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,VALTANE,I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,On screen! ...Magnify!,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,COMPUTER VOICE,Computer enhancement.,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,Praxis?,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,VALTANE,"What's left of it, sir.",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,RAND,"Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,Let's have it.,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,KERLA (on viewscreen),"This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command. There has been an incident on Praxis. However everything is under control. We have no need for assistance. Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone. This transmission ends now.",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,An incident?,[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,RAND,"Do we report this, sir?",[Excelsior bridge],
1.0,SULU,Are you kidding?,[Excelsior bridge],
2.0,,,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,What are we doing here?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,McCOY,Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SCOTT,That suits me. I just bought a boat.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,UHURA,This had better be good. I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,CHEKOV,"Captain, isn't this just for top brass?",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,MCCOY,"If we're all here, where's Sulu?",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,Captain Sulu. On assignment. Where's Spock?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,AIDE-DE-CAMP,"This briefing is classified. Ladies and Gentlemen, the C-in-C.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,"As you were. To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly fifty years of life left to it. For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,Good morning. Two months ago a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions. The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone. They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately fifty Earth years.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,ATTENDEE,(aside) That's not in any of the data I saw.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe. Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to commence negotiations at once.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,CARTWRIGHT,Negotiations for what?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the Neutral Zone, an end to almost seventy years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,MILITARY AIDE,"Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,"Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, Captain, but...",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,CARTWRIGHT,"I must protest. To offer the Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide. Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy. And if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory. The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees. Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,Sir!,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,Captain Kirk?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,The Klingons have never been trustworthy. I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright. This is a terrifying idea.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his Empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,"You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth, and to escort him safely through Federation space.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,Me?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,"Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright. But they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,You ...have personally ...vouched?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C-IN-C,"You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,But a full Ambassador would be better equipped...,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,C in C,If there's no further business ...I wish you and your crew Godspeed. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. ...I remind you this meeting is classified.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,CARTWRIGHT,"I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,McCOY,I wouldn't!,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,We volunteered?,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,There's an old Vulcan proverb. 'Only Nixon could go to China.',[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,How could you vouch for me? That's ...arrogant presumption.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,My father requested that I open negotia...,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,"I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this. They're animals!",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,"Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.",[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,Don't believe them! Don't trust them!,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,SPOCK,They are dying.,[Starfleet briefing room],
2.0,KIRK,Let them die! Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months? We've done our bit for King and Country. You should have trusted me.,[Starfleet briefing room],

5.0,VALERIS,"We are almost at the rendezvous, sir. I thought that you would like to know.",[Kirk's quarters],"Captain's log. (continued) I can never forgive them for the death of my boy. To me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit ...is problematic, at best. Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him. But how on earth can history get past people like me?"
