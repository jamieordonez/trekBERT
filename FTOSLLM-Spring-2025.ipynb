    "### Overview\n",
    "In this project, you will fine-tune a **Masked Language Model (MLM)** on a domain-specific dataset of your choice. The goal is to understand the process of preparing data, fine-tuning an MLM, evaluating its performance, and iterating on the results. You will measure the modelâ€™s performance before and after fine-tuning using **Perplexity** or another suitable metric.\n"
