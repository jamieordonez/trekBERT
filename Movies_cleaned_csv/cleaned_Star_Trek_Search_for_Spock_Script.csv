Yet I feel uneasy and I wonder why. Perhaps it's the emptiness of this vessel. Most of our trainee crew has been reassigned. Lieutenant Saavik and my son, David are exploring the Genesis planet which he helped create. And Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone. No, more empty than even that. The death of Spock is like an open wound. It seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there ...on that newborn planet."

25.0,KIRK (on viewscreen),"To fully understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus. Genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness. It was the intention to introduce the Genesis Device into a preselected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form. The device when delivered would instantaneously cause the Genesis effect. Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists, capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],

26.0,ESTEBAN,Wait a minute! ...We don't know what we're talking about here.,[Grissom bridge],
26.0,DAVID,Why don't we beam it up?,[Grissom bridge],
26.0,ESTEBAN,"Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state, 'nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated.'",[Grissom bridge],
26.0,SAAVIK,"Captain, ...the logical alternative is obvious. ...Beaming down to the surface is permitted.",[Grissom bridge],
26.0,ESTEBAN,"Yes, if the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger.",[Grissom bridge],
26.0,DAVID,"Captain, please, ...we'll take the risk, but we've got to find out what it is.",[Grissom bridge],

27.0,UHURA,"Sir? About Doctor McCoy, how is he?",[Kirk's apartment],
27.0,KIRK,"He's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquillisers. They say it's exhaustion. He promised me he'd stay put. Well we'll see.",[Kirk's apartment],

27.0,SAREK,Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.,[Kirk's apartment],
27.0,KIRK,But ...why?,[Kirk's apartment],
27.0,SAREK,"Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us ...and bring that which he gave you, his katra, his living spirit.",[Kirk's apartment],
27.0,KIRK,"Sir, ...your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. Believe me when I tell you ...he made no request of me!",[Kirk's apartment],

27.0,KIRK,We were separated! He couldn't touch me.,[Kirk's apartment],
27.0,SAREK,I see. ...Then everything that he was. ...Everything that he knew ...is lost.,[Kirk's apartment],
