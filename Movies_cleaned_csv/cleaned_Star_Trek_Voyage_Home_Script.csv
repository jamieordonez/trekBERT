0.0,"(scenes from ""Star Trek III","The Search for Spock.""",,"Captain's log, stardate 8031 in the twenty-third century. As commanding officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise, I look back on our most recent adventure and realise I could not have asked for a more dependable ship or dedicated crew. Chekov, Doctor McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and our late comrade, Spock, whose heroic sacrifice in our last mission is now deeply felt. Our ship and our lives have been endangered by an experimental project called Genesis designed to bring new life to barren moons. We sent Spock's body there to rest in peace."

27.0,UHURA,Yes sir. ...On speakers.,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,KIRK,Spock? What do you make of that?,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,SPOCK,Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great power and intelligence. Evidently unaware that its transmissions are disruptive. I find it illogical that its intentions could be hostile.,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,McCOY,"Well, dammit? You think this is its way of saying 'Hi there' to the people of the Earth?",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,SPOCK,"There are other forms on intelligence on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message must be meant for man.",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,KIRK,You're suggesting the transmission is meant for lifeform other than man?,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,SPOCK,"It is a possibility, Admiral. The President did say that it was directed at Earth's oceans",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,KIRK,"Uhura, ...can you modify the Probe's signals accounting for density and temperature and salinity factors?",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,UHURA,"I'll try, sir. ...I think I have it.",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,KIRK,And this is what it would sound like underwater?,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,UHURA,Yes sir.,[Bird-of-Prey bridge],
27.0,SPOCK,"Fascinating. If my suspicion is correct, there can be no response to this message.",[Bird-of-Prey bridge],

28.0,KIRK,Whales?,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,"Specifically, humpback whales.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,McCOY,That's crazy! Who would send a Probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,KIRK,It's possible. Whales have been on Earth far earlier than man.,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,Ten million years earlier. And humpbacks were heavily hunted by man. They've been extinct since the twentyfirst century. It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the Probe to determine why they lost contact.,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,McCOY,My God!,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,KIRK,"Spock, could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated?",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,"The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,KIRK,Does the species exist on any other planet?,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,Negative. Humpbacks were indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,KIRK,Then we have no choice. We must destroy the Probe before it destroys Earth.,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,"To attempt to do so would be futile, Admiral. The Probe could render us neutral easily.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,KIRK,But we can't turn away! ...There must be an alternative?,[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,"There is one possibility, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some humpback whales.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,McCOY,"You just said there aren't any, except on Earth of the past.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,SPOCK,"Yes Doctor, that's exactly what I said.",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],
28.0,McCOY,"Well, in that case... Now wait just a damn minute!",[Bird-of-Prey computer room],

As you can see we have a great deal to offer, but that is small compared to what we know, ...or rather what we don't know, about whales. The first commonly held misconception is that whales are fish.

44.0,KIRK,You mean man.,[Cetacean Institute],
44.0,GILLIAN,"To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. One hundred years ago, using handthrown harpoons, man did plenty of damage, ...but that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century. ...This is mankind's legacy, whales hunted to the brink of extinction. Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature ever to inhabit the Earth. Despite all attempts at banning whaling, there are still countries and pirates currently engaged in the slaughter of these inoffensive creatures. Where the humpback whale once numbered in the hundreds of thousands, today there are less than ten thousand specimens alive and those that are taken are no longer fully grown. In addition, many of the females are killed, while still bearing unborn calves.",[Cetacean Institute],

54.0,KIRK,"What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.",[Road near the Cetacean Institute],
54.0,GILLIAN,It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters ...same as the rest of the humpbacks. ...What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?,[Road near the Cetacean Institute],
54.0,SPOCK,I meant...,[Road near the Cetacean Institute],
