1.0,BORG QUEEN (OC),Locutus.,[Picard's quarters],
1.0,PICARD,I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile.,[Picard's quarters],"(Picard is having a dream about his memories from end of ""Best of Both Worlds, Part I."")"
1.0,PICARD,Authorisation Picard four seven alpha tango. ...Admiral?,[Picard's quarters],
1.0,HAYES (on viewer),Did I catch you at a bad time JeanLuc?,[Picard's quarters],(he is awakened by a comm bleep just as he is starting to be assimilated)
1.0,PICARD,"No, of course not.",[Picard's quarters],
1.0,HAYES (on viewer),I've just received a disturbing report from Deep Space 5. Our colony on Ivor Prime was destroyed this morning. Longrange sensors have picked up...,[Picard's quarters],
1.0,PICARD,"Yes, I know. ...The Borg.",[Picard's quarters],
2.0,RIKER,How many ships?,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],"Captains log, stardate 50893.5. The moment I have dreaded for nearly six years has finally arrived. The Borg, our most lethal enemy have begun an invasion of the Federation, and this time there may be no stopping them."
2.0,PICARD,"One, and it's on a direct course for Earth. It'll cross the Federation border in less than an hour. Admiral Hayes is mobilising a fleet in the Typhon sector.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,DATA,At maximum warp it will take us three hours twentyfive minutes.,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,PICARD,We're not going.,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,RIKER,"What do you mean, 'We're not going'?",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,PICARD,"Our orders are to patrol the Neutral Zone, in case the Romulans decide to take advantage of the situation.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,TROI,The Romulans?,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,DATA,"Captain, there has been no unusual activity along the Romulan border for nine months. It seems highly unlikely they would choose this moment to start a conflict.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,CRUSHER,Does Starfleet feel we need more shakedown time?,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,LAFORGE,"Captain, we've been out in space for nearly a year now. We're ready! The EnterpriseE is the most advanced starship in the fleet. We should be on the front line.",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
2.0,PICARD,"I have gone over all this with Starfleet Command. Their orders stand. ...Number One, set a course for the Neutral Zone",[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
3.0,RIKER,Bizet?,[Picard's quarters],
3.0,PICARD,Berlioz. What do you have?,[Picard's quarters],(classical music is playing)
3.0,RIKER,We've finished our first sensor sweep of the Neutral Zone.,[Picard's quarters],
3.0,PICARD,"Oh, fascinating. Twenty particles of space dust per cubic metre. Fiftytwo ultraviolet radiation spikes and a class two comet. Well, this is certainly worthy of our attention.",[Picard's quarters],
3.0,RIKER,"Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?",[Picard's quarters],
3.0,PICARD,Let's just say that Starfleet has every confidence in the Enterprise and her crew. They're just not sure about her Captain. They believe that a man who was once captured and assimilated by the Borg should not be put in a situation where he would face them again. To do so would introduce an unstable element to a critical situation,[Picard's quarters],
3.0,RIKER,That's ridiculous! Your experience of the Borg makes you the perfect man to lead this fight.,[Picard's quarters],
3.0,PICARD,Admiral Hayes disagrees.,[Picard's quarters],
3.0,TROI (on intercom),Bridge to Captain Picard.,[Picard's quarters],

6.0,RIKER,"Captain, the Admiral's ship has been destroyed.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,What is the status of the Borg cube?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,It has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull. I am reading fluctuations in their power grid.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,"On screen. ...Number One, open a channel to the fleet.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,RIKER,Channel open.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise. I am taking command of the fleet. Target all of your weapons onto the following coordinates. ...Fire on my command.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,"Sir, the coordinates you have indicated do not appear to be a vital system.",[Enterprise-E bridge],

6.0,PICARD,"Adrift, but salvageable.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,RIKER,Tough little ship.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,WORF,Little?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,"Mister Worf, we could use some help at tactical.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,RIKER,You do remember how to fire phasers?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,Sensors show chronometric particles emanating from the sphere.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,They're creating a temporal vortex.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,RIKER,Time travel!,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,"Data, report!",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,We appear to be caught in a temporal wake.,[Enterprise-E bridge],(the Enterprise suffers a shockwave)
6.0,WORF,"Captain, ...Earth.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,"The atmosphere contains high concentrations of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,Life signs?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,Population ...approximately nine billion. ...All Borg!,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,TROI,How?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,They must have done it in the past. ...They went back and assimilated Earth. ...Changed history.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,CRUSHER,Then if they changed history why are we still here?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,The temporal wake must somehow have protected us from the changes in the timeline.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,DATA,"Sir, the vortex is collapsing.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
6.0,PICARD,"Hold your course, Mister Hawk. We must follow them back. Repair whatever damage they've done.",[Enterprise-E bridge],(Data's console bleeps)
7.0,LILY,Come on.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,Good night Eddie. to Lily ...Go home.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,LILY,You're gonna regret this tomorrow.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,"Well, what I think you should have learned about me by now is that I don't have regrets. ...Come on, Lily, one more round.",[Montana settlement],
7.0,LILY,"Z, you've had enough. I'm not going up in that thing with a drunken pilot.",[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,But I sure as hell's not going up there sober.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,LILY,What is that?,[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,That is the constellation Leo.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,LILY,"No, that.",[Montana settlement],
7.0,LILY,It's the ECON.,[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,After all these years?,[Montana settlement],(there is a bright orbiting light which suddenly fires two photon bolts towards the settlement)
7.0,LILY,We've got to get to the Phoenix!,[Montana settlement],
7.0,COCHRANE,To hell with the Phoenix.,[Montana settlement],
8.0,PICARD,Report.,[Enterprise-E bridge],(the attack continues and the Enterprise enters Earth orbit through the vortex)
8.0,RIKER,Shields are down. Longrange sensors are offline. Main power's holding,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,DATA,According to our astrometric readings we're in the mid twentyfirst century. From the radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere I would estimate we have arrived approximately ten years after the Third World War.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,RIKER,Makes sense. Most of the major cities have been destroyed. There are few governments left. Six hundred million dead. No resistance.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,WORF,Captain!,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,PICARD,Mister Worf. Quantum torpedoes.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,WORF,"Ready, sir.",[Enterprise-E bridge],(the Borg sphere is firing at the surface)
8.0,PICARD,Fire.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,PICARD,They were firing at the surface. Location?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,RIKER,"Western hemisphere, ...North American continent. At a missile complex in central Montana.",[Enterprise-E bridge],(the Borg sphere explodes)
8.0,PICARD,"A missile complex? ...The date? Mister Data, I need to know the exact date.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,DATA,"April fourth, two thousand sixtythree.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,PICARD,April fourth?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,RIKER,The day before First Contact.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,DATA,Precisely.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,CRUSHER (OC),Then the missile complex must be the one where Zefram Cochrane is building his warp ship.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,PICARD,That's what they came here to do. Stop First Contact.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,RIKER,"How much damage, Lieutenant?",[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,HAWK,I can't tell. Longrange sensors are still offline.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
8.0,PICARD,"We'll have to go down there. Find out what happened. Data, Beverly, you're with me. Have a security team meet us in transporter room three. Computer. Midtwentyfirst century civilian clothing. ...Number One, you have the bridge.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
9.0,PICARD,Over here.,[Montana settlement],
10.0,CRUSHER,They're all dead.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD,"See if one of them is Cochrane. Data, let's go check the warp ship.",[Titan V silo],
10.0,DATA,The structural integrity of the missile appears to be in tact. The fuselage is slightly damaged.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD,We should have the original blueprints on the Enterprise computer. Commander La Forge will need to bring a team down here.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD (OC),Hold your fire! We're here to help you!,[Titan V silo],
10.0,LILY,Bullshit!,[Titan V silo],(Lily lets off a burst of rifle fire at them from below)
10.0,DATA,"Captain, I believe I can handle this.",[Titan V silo],
10.0,DATA,Greetings!,[Titan V silo],
10.0,DATA,"Captain, this woman requires medical attention.",[Titan V silo],
10.0,CRUSHER,Severe theta radiation poisoning.,[Titan V silo],(Lily faints)
10.0,DATA,Radiation is coming from the damaged throttle assembly.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,CRUSHER,"We're all gonna have to be inoculated, ...and I have to get her to sickbay.",[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD,Doctor...,[Titan V silo],
10.0,CRUSHER,"Please, no lectures about the Prime Directive. I will keep her unconscious.",[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD,Very well. Tell Commander Riker to beam down with a search party. We need to find Cochrane.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,CRUSHER,Crusher to Enterprise. Two to beam directly to sickbay.,[Titan V silo],
10.0,PICARD,We have less than fortyeight hours before this ship has to be launched. Picard to engineering.,[Titan V silo],
11.0,LAFORGE,La Forge here.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
12.0,PICARD,"Geordi, Cochrane's ship was damaged in the attack. Get down here with an engineering detail. We have work to do.",[Titan V silo],
13.0,LAFORGE,"Right, I'm on my way, Captain. Alpha team. Let's assemble in transporter room three. We're heading down to the surface. ...Porter, you're gonna be in command 'til I get back. And, Porter, check out the environmental controls while I'm gone. It's getting a little warm in here. All right, let's go.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
14.0,PICARD,Isn't it amazing? This ship used to be a nuclear missile.,[Titan V silo],
14.0,DATA,It is an historical irony that Doctor Cochrane would use an instrument of massdestruction to inaugurate an era of peace.,[Titan V silo],
14.0,PICARD,"It's a boyhood fantasy, Data. I must have seen this ship hundreds of times in the Smithsonian, but I was never able to touch it.",[Titan V silo],
14.0,DATA,"Sir, does tactile contact alter your perception of the Phoenix?",[Titan V silo],(Picard feels the Titan V rocket)
14.0,PICARD,"Oh, yes. For humans, touch can connect you to an object in a very personal way. It makes it seem more real.",[Titan V silo],
14.0,DATA,I am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing. Temperature variations in the fuel manifold. It's no more real to me now than it was a moment ago.,[Titan V silo],
14.0,TROI,Would you three like to be alone?,[Titan V silo],
14.0,PICARD,What have you found out?,[Titan V silo],
14.0,TROI,There's no sign of Cochrane anywhere in the complex.,[Titan V silo],
14.0,PICARD,He has to be here. There was nothing more important to him than this ship. This flight. It was his dream.,[Titan V silo],
14.0,TROI,"Captain, we should consider the possibility that Doctor Cochrane was killed in the attack.",[Titan V silo],
14.0,PICARD,Huh. If that's true then the future may die with him.,[Titan V silo],
15.0,EIGER,What do you think?,[Enterprise-E engineering],
15.0,PORTER,"That the entire environmental system's gone crazy. It's not just engineering, it's the entire deck. Maybe it's a problem with the EPS conduits.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
16.0,PORTER,Hello? ...Hey!,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
16.0,EIGER (OC),Are you talking to me?,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
16.0,PORTER,Is there any one else working maintenance in this section?,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
16.0,EIGER (OC),Not that I know of.,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
16.0,PORTER (OC),Aarrgh!,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
17.0,EIGER,"Paul? ...Paul, are you okay in there?",[Enterprise-E engineering],
18.0,EIGER,Aarrgh!,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
19.0,TROI,"Captain, what is it?",[Titan V silo],
19.0,PICARD,"Picard to Enterprise. Mister Worf, is everything all right up there?",[Titan V silo],
19.0,WORF (on intercom),Yes sir. We are experiencing some environmental difficulties on deck sixteen but that is all.,[Titan V silo],
19.0,PICARD,What kind of difficulties?,[Titan V silo],
19.0,WORF (on intercom),Humidity levels have risen seventythree percent and the temperature has jumped ten degrees in the last hour.,[Titan V silo],
19.0,PICARD,Mister Data and I are returning to the ship.,[Titan V silo],
19.0,WORF (on intercom),Understood.,[Titan V silo],
19.0,PICARD,"Number One, take charge down here.",[Titan V silo],
19.0,RIKER,Aye sir.,[Titan V silo],
20.0,CRUSHER,The damage to her cell membranes is repaired. She should be fine but I'd like to run another test on the spinal tissue. Would you find out why it's so hot in here?,[Enterprise-E sickbay],
20.0,CRUSHER,Now what? Crusher to engineering. ...Crusher to bridge.,[Enterprise-E sickbay],
21.0,PICARD,Commander Worf. I need to know exactly what's been happening.,[Enterprise-E bridge],(there is a huge thud behind her)
21.0,WORF,"We have lost contact with deck sixteen. Communications, internal sensors, everything. I was about to send a security team to investigate.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,PICARD,No! Seal off deck sixteen. Post security teams at every access point.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,WORF,Aye sir.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,PICARD,"Mister Hawk, before we lost internal sensors what were the exact environmental conditions in main engineering?",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,HAWK,"Atmospheric pressure was two kilopascals above normal, ninetytwo percent humidity, thirtynine point one degrees Celsius.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,PICARD,"Thirtynine point one degrees Celsius. ...Like a Borg ship. They knew their ship was doomed, our shields were down and somehow they transported over here without being detected. They'll assimilate the Enterprise, and then ...Earth. ...Picard to Riker. ...Enterprise to away team. ...Respond.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,HAWK,"Sir, the main control is being rerouted through main engineering. ...Weapons, shields, propulsion.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,PICARD,"Quickly, Mister Data. Lock out the main computer.",[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,DATA,I have isolated the main computer with a fractal encryption code. It is highly unlikely the Borg will be able to break it.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,WORF,The Borg have cut power to all decks except sixteen.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
21.0,PICARD,The Borg won't stay on deck sixteen.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
22.0,CRUSHER,"Wake up, you're all right. Come on, come on, wake up.",[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,CRUSHER,"Hold steady. Stay calm. You are all right. Now listen to me. You're going to be fine, listen to me. I just need you to do as I say. ...Alyssa, is the EMH programme still on line?",[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,OGAWA,"It should be, sir.",[Enterprise-E sickbay],"(Lily comes to, panicking)"
22.0,CRUSHER,Computer. Activate the EMH programme.,[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,EMERGENCY MEDICAL HOLOGRAM,Please state the nature of the medical emergency.,[Enterprise-E sickbay],(there is more thudding)
22.0,CRUSHER,Twenty Borg are about to break through that door. We need time to get out of here. Create a diversion.,[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,EMERGENCY MEDICAL HOLOGRAM,"This isn't part of my programme. I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.",[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,CRUSHER,Well do a dance. Tell a story. I don't care. Just give us a few seconds.,[Enterprise-E sickbay],
22.0,EMERGENCY MEDICAL HOLOGRAM,"According to Starfleet medical research, Borg implants can cause severe skin irritations. Perhaps you'd like an analgesic cream.",[Enterprise-E sickbay],
23.0,OGAWA,Which way?,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
23.0,CRUSHER,We need to get off this deck. Follow me.,[Enterprise-E Jefferies tube],
24.0,PICARD,"The first thing they'll do in engineering is establish a collective, a central point from which they can control the hive. The problem is if we begin firing particle weapons in engineering there's a risk we may hit the warp core. I believe our goal should be to puncture one of the plasma coolant tanks. Data?",[Enterprise-E armoury],(Lily heads off in another direction)
24.0,DATA,Excellent idea. Plasma coolant will liquefy organic material on contact.,[Enterprise-E armoury],
24.0,WORF,But the Borg are not entirely organic.,[Enterprise-E armoury],
24.0,PICARD,"True, but like all cybernetic lifeforms they cannot survive without their organic components.",[Enterprise-E armoury],
24.0,WORF,I have ordered all weapons to be set on a rotating modulation. The Borg will adapt quickly. We will be able to fire twelve shots at most.,[Enterprise-E armoury],
24.0,PICARD,One other thing. ...You may encounter Enterprise crewmembers who've already been assimilated. Don't hesitate to fire. Believe me you'll be doing them a favour. ...Let's go.,[Enterprise-E armoury],
25.0,RIKER,Deanna! ...Deanna! Deanna!,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,"No! No, don't turn it off that...",[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,Who is this jerk? ...And who told him he could turn off my music?,[Montana settlement bar],(Riker rips out the power lead silencing the music)
25.0,TROI,Will Riker. ...Zefram Cochrane.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,Is he a friend of yours?,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,Yes.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,Husband?,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,No.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,"Good! ...Now this, Deena...",[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,Deanna.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,This ...is the good stuff.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,Doctor Cochrane...,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,To the Phoenix. ...May she rest in peace.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,COCHRANE,"Okay, that wasn't so good.",[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,"Will, I think we have to tell him the truth.",[Montana settlement bar],(Cochrane and Troi knock back their slugs with some reaction)
25.0,RIKER,If we tell the truth the timeline...,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,Timeline! This is no time to argue about time. We don't have the time! ...What was I saying?,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,You're drunk.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,I am not.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,You are.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,Look. He wouldn't even talk to me unless I had a drink with him. And then it took three shots of something called tequila just to find out he was the one we're looking for. And I've spent the last twenty minutes trying to keep his hands off me. So don't go criticising my counselling techniques. ...It's a primitive culture. I'm just trying to blend in.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,You're blending all right.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,I've already told him our cover story. He didn't believe me.,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,Yes. We're running out of time. Now if we tell him the truth do you think he'll be able to handle it?,[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,TROI,"If you're looking for my professional opinion as ship's Counselor, ...he's nuts.",[Montana settlement bar],
25.0,RIKER,I'll be sure to note that in my log.,[Montana settlement bar],
26.0,DATA,"Captain, I believe I am feeling ...anxiety. It's an intriguing sensation. A most distracting...",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,PICARD,"Data, I'm sure it's a fascinating experience. Perhaps you should deactivate your emotion chip for now.",[Enterprise-E corridors],(security parties led by Picard and Worf discover Borg cubicles)
26.0,DATA,"Good idea, sir. ...Done.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,PICARD,"Data, there are times when I envy you.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,CRUSHER,It's only me!,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,WORF,Are you all right?,[Enterprise-E corridors],(Worf's party is startled by a hatch opening)
26.0,CRUSHER,Yes but we have wounded here.,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,WORF,"Lopez, get these people back to deck fourteen.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,CRUSHER,There was a civilian. A woman from the twentyfirst century. We got separated.,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,WORF,We'll watch for her.,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,CRUSHER,"Worf, she has no idea what's going on. Try to find her.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,PICARD,Lower your weapons. They'll ignore us 'til they consider us a threat.,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,PICARD,"The manual release? ...Mister Worf, hold this position.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,COMPUTER VOICE,Manual release is online.,[Enterprise-E corridors],(the two parties meet up outside main engineering)
26.0,PICARD,Perhaps we should just knock?,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,PICARD,Data.,[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,WORF,Ready phasers!,[Enterprise-E corridors],(Borg drones begin to stir)
26.0,PICARD,"Data, cover me.",[Enterprise-E corridors],
26.0,WORF,"Captain, they have adapted!",[Enterprise-E corridors],(a firefight develops)
26.0,PICARD,Regroup on deck fifteen. Don't let them touch you!,[Enterprise-E corridors],

27.0,PICARD,Calm down!,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
27.0,LILY,Down! Who are you?,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
27.0,PICARD,My name is JeanLuc Picard...,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],

27.0,PICARD,All right! ...Follow me.,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
27.0,LILY,Slow!,[Enterprise-E observation lounge],
28.0,DATA,Your efforts to break the encryption code will not be successful. Nor will your attempt to assimilate me into your collective.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
28.0,BORG QUEEN (OC),Brave words. I've heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds ...since long before you were created. But now they are all Borg.,[Enterprise-E engineering],(Data is on a Borg bio-bed with Borg working at a console)

30.0,RIKER,Simple. Conduct your warp flight tomorrow morning just as you planned.,[Montana settlement],
30.0,COCHRANE,Why tomorrow morning?,[Montana settlement],
30.0,RIKER,Because at eleven o'clock an alien ship will begin passing through this solar system.,[Montana settlement],
30.0,COCHRANE,Alien? You mean extraterrestrials. More bad guys?,[Montana settlement],
30.0,TROI,Good guys. They're on a survey mission. They have no interest in Earth. ...Too primitive.,[Montana settlement],
30.0,COCHRANE,Oh!,[Montana settlement],

30.0,LAFORGE,"Sir, it's actually over there.",[Montana settlement],

30.0,COCHRANE,"And you people, you're all astronauts, ... on some kind of star trek?",[Montana settlement],
30.0,LAFORGE,"Look, Doc, I know this is a lot for you to take in, but we're running out of time here.",[Montana settlement],
30.0,RIKER,We need your help. ...What do you say?,[Montana settlement],
30.0,COCHRANE,Why not?,[Montana settlement],
31.0,DANIELS,"It's pretty bad, sir. It looks like they control decks twentysix up to eleven. But when they took deck eleven they just stopped.",[Enterprise-E bridge],(the fight against assimilation continues in the Enterprise corridors)

34.0,DATA,Who are you?,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN (OC),I am the Borg.,[Enterprise-E engineering],

34.0,BORG QUEEN,You imply disparity where none exists. I am the collective.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,Perhaps I should rephrase the question. I wish to understand the organisational relationship. Are you their leader?,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,I bring order to chaos.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,"An interesting, if cryptic response.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,"You are in chaos, Data. You are the contradiction. A machine who wishes to be human.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,"As you seem to know so much about me, you must be aware that I am programmed to evolve and better myself.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,We too are on a quest to better ourselves. Evolving toward a state of perfection.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,Forgive me. The Borg do not evolve. They conquer.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,"By assimilating other beings into our collective, we are bringing them closer to perfection.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,Somehow I question your motives.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,That is because you haven't been properly ...stimulated yet.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,"Heh, heh, heh. You have reactivated my emotion chip. ...Why?",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,Don't be frightened.,[Enterprise-E engineering],

34.0,BORG QUEEN,"Do you know what this is, Data?",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,It would appear you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,What a cold description for such a beautiful gift.,[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,DATA,"Heh, heh, heh.",[Enterprise-E engineering],
34.0,BORG QUEEN,Was that good for you?,[Enterprise-E engineering],(the Borg Queen strokes the section of skin)
35.0,LILY,How many planets are in this Federation?,[Enterprise-E corridors],

36.0,HENCHMAN,Hey! I'm gonna take that personal.,[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,PICARD,No offence.,[Enterprise-E holodeck],(Picard picks up Nicky's henchman and fleeces him. As the two Borg approach a waiter gets pushed to the floor)
36.0,HENCHMAN,Hey!,[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,LILY,I think you got 'em. ...I don't get it. I thought you said this was all just a bunch of holograms. If it was just a hologram...,[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,PICARD,I disengaged the safety protocols. Without them even a holographic bullet can kill.,[Enterprise-E holodeck],"(Lily smashes the henchman over the head with an ice bucket. Picard takes a tommy gun out of the case and blasts the two Borg, then raises the gun to smash down on one)"
36.0,LILY,What are you doing?,[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,PICARD,I'm looking for the neural processor. Every Borg has one. It's like a memory chip. It will contain a record of all the instructions this Borg has been receiving from the collective.,[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,LILY,"Oh my! JeanLuc, it's one of your uniforms.",[Enterprise-E holodeck],
36.0,PICARD,"Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.",[Enterprise-E holodeck],

37.0,COCHRANE,Yeah.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,Would you mind taking a look at this?,[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,Yeah.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,I've tried to reconstruct the intermix chamber from what I remember at school. Tell me if I got it right.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,School? You learned about this in school?,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,Oh yeah. 'Basic Warp Design' is a required course at the Academy. The first chapter is called 'Zefram Cochrane'.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,"Well, it looks like you got it right.",[Montana settlement],
37.0,BARCLAY,Commander. This is what we're thinking of using to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, that's good, but you need to reinforce this copper tubing with a nanopolymer.",[Montana settlement],
37.0,BARCLAY,"Doctor Cochrane. I know this sounds silly, but can I shake your hand? ...Thank you, Doctor. I can't tell you what an honour it is to work with you on this project.",[Montana settlement],(Geordi uses his ocular implant to examine a spiral of copper tubing)
37.0,LAFORGE,Reg!,[Montana settlement],
37.0,BARCLAY,I never imagined I'd be meeting the man who invented the warp drive.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,Reg!,[Montana settlement],
37.0,BARCLAY,I'm sorry. Right. ...Thanks.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,Do they have to keep doing this?,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,"It's just a little hero worship, Doctor. To tell you the truth I can't say I blame them. We all grew up hearing about what you did. Or what you're about to do. You know I probably shouldn't be telling you this but I went to Zefram Cochrane High School.",[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,Really?,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,You know? I wish I had a picture of this.,[Montana settlement],
37.0,COCHRANE,What?,[Montana settlement],

37.0,COCHRANE,Statue?,[Montana settlement],

37.0,COCHRANE,I gotta to take a leak!,[Montana settlement],
37.0,LAFORGE,Leak? I'm not detecting any leak.,[Montana settlement],

38.0,WORF,The Borg control over half the ship. We have tried to restore power to the bridge and the weapons systems but we have been unsuccessful.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,PICARD,We have another problem. I've accessed a Borg neural processor and I've discovered what they are trying to do. They're transforming the deflector dish into an interplexing beacon.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,HAWK,Interplexing?,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,PICARD,It's a subspace transmitter. If they activate the beacon they'll be able to establish a link with the Borg living in this century.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,CRUSHER,But in the twentyfirst century the Borg are still in the Delta Quadrant.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,PICARD,They'll send reinforcements. Humanity will be an easy target. Attack the Earth in the past ...to assimilate the future.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,WORF,Then we must destroy the deflector dish before they can activate the beacon.,[Enterprise-E bridge],
38.0,PICARD,"We can't get to deflector control or the shuttlecraft. ...Mister Worf, do you remember your zeroG combat training?",[Enterprise-E bridge],

43.0,WORF,We should bring reinforcements.,[Enterprise-E underside],(the Borg Queen kisses him and he returns the kiss)
43.0,PICARD,There's no time. It looks as if they're building the beacon right on top of the particle emitter. Once all the transponder rods are in place the beacon will be activated.,[Enterprise-E underside],
43.0,HAWK,Well if we set our phasers to full power...,[Enterprise-E underside],
43.0,PICARD,No! There's a risk that we hit the dish. It's charged with antiprotons. We could destroy half the ship. We have to find another way.,[Enterprise-E underside],
